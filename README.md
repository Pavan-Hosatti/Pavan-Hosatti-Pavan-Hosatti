🚀 Featured Projects
🌾 Farm2Market
Voice-controlled agricultural marketplace in Kannada
Farmers speak, system responds. Custom ML model handles voice commands, MERN stack powers the backend, OAuth secures users, deployed via CI/CD pipeline. Real farmers, real impact.

Tech: Voice AI MERN Stack ML Model CI/CD OAuth

🍽️ 3D Restaurant Experience
Immersive restaurant website with 3D visualization
Three.js 3D models, integrated payment gateway, Firebase backend handling orders in real-time. Deployed end-to-end with proper auth flow.

Tech: Three.js Firebase Payment Gateway 3D Graphics

🎮 CatchVerse
Interactive game with smooth animations
Built with React ecosystem. Redux for state management, Framer Motion for smooth animations. Fast, responsive, actually fun to play.

Tech: React Redux Framer Motion Animations

✅ Task Manager
Pre-React era productivity app
Built with vanilla JS, confetti animations when you complete tasks (because dopamine matters), clean architecture that doesn't need a framework to be elegant.

Tech: Vanilla JS Confetti Animations Clean Architecture

🎯 Core Values
🚀 Ship First, Perfect Later
Real users > perfect code. Deploy fast, learn faster, iterate constantly.

🌍 Tech That Matters
Building solutions for real problems. From farmers to sustainability, tech should create impact.

🧠 Learn By Building
Documentation is great, but nothing beats shipping a project. Break things, fix things, repeat.

🗣️ Explain to Understand
If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. Teaching deepens knowledge.

🔮 Vision
Building the bridge between AI/ML and real-world applications. Too many models sit in notebooks—I want to see them in production, solving actual problems. Whether it's voice interfaces for farmers who can't read, automated workflows that save hours of manual work, or intelligent systems that make decisions in real-time, the goal is simple: make AI accessible and useful.

Currently exploring the intersection of ML, backend systems, and seamless user experiences. The future isn't just about building smarter models—it's about deploying them where they matter most.

## About Me

ML + Backend Systems specialist focused on connecting AI with real-world applications. Beyond code, I'm into acting, writing, anchoring, and marketing—because the best developers understand people, not just programs.

**Current Focus:** Deploying ML models in production where they actually matter, building scalable backend systems, and creating seamless user experiences.

## Achievements

**🥇 First Place** — Farm2Market Pitch Deck  
Voice-controlled agricultural marketplace in Kannada. Pitched complete system including ML voice recognition, MERN stack, OAuth, and CI/CD pipeline.

**🥉 Third Place** — CIT Ideathon (RePad)  
Menstrual pad disposal solution. Building tech that solves social problems.

**🎤 Public Speaker & Tech Anchor**  
Hosting tech events and explaining complex systems. If you can't explain it, you don't understand it well enough.

## Core Philosophy

**Ship First, Perfect Later** — Real users > perfect code. Deploy fast, learn faster, iterate constantly.

**Tech That Matters** — Building solutions for real problems, from farmers to sustainability.

**Learn By Building** — Documentation is great, but nothing beats shipping a project.

**Explain to Understand** — Teaching deepens knowledge. Simplicity is sophistication.

## Vision

Too many ML models sit in notebooks. I want to see them in production, solving actual problems—whether it's voice interfaces for farmers who can't read, automated workflows saving hours of work, or intelligent systems making real-time decisions.

The future isn't just about building smarter models. It's about deploying them where they matter most.
